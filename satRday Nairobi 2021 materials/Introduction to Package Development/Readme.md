The R software is very versatile. It comes with some in-built packages and several thousand additional packages in various repositories that expand its functionalities. Yet sometimes, you might not find the right function for the task youâ€™d like to complete, or the process might be complex and you would want to simplify it with a function. R package allows you the opportunity to organize these functions, validate them, and make them available to others. The {tidyndr} package provides an example of such a specialized package, developed by the author for the Nigeria National (HIV) Data Repository.
Recent developments in R have made the process of creating an R package very easy. In this workshop, we will walk through the step-by-step process of package development. We will be learning about:

1. How to create a simple R package.
2. How to deploy the package to Github
3. How to install the package from Github
4. The steps involved in deploying your package to CRAN
