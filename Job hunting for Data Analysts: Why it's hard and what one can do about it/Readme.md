## 19th February 2022

### Our trainer: Oscar Baruffa (Twitter handle --> @OscarBaruffa), Data Specialist

Biography : Oscar Baruffa is a Data Specialist helping non-profits achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development goals and is currently working in the international development sector directing the development of a full data and analytics pipeline. Previous roles have seen him modeling energy consumption of buildings, auditing energy use and carbon emission metrics, and closely following macro and micro-economic trends in plastic recycling value chains. His 15-year career has seen him on both sides of the hiring table many times and has valuable insights to share. Oscar is also the author of the bigbookofr, which is an amazing collection of R-related programming books. If you know anyone who is starting out or wants to advance their skills in R, please forward them the link to the book. We have posted it on the chat.

**The main aim of the presentation will be to demystify the hiring process and give concrete examples of how to improve one's chances.** 

Oscar will  explain why it is that applying to hundreds of jobs can still result in getting no interviews or even responses. Basically, he’ll help to alleviate the "sense of failure" from participants. He’ll then go onto the single biggest improvement he thinks people can make, and that's to their CV and cover letter. He’s seen so many poor ones that can basically  be improved in the same way. He’ll also touch on a strategy he uses when job hunting to conserve his energy and emotional state!
